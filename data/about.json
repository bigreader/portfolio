		"Hey, I’m Josh! I’m a designer and developer for interactive sites, apps and other tools to make people’s lives better. My childhood curiosity about how things work has become a passion for building intuitive, powerful experiences. I love everything from graphic design to back-end code; I’ve spent years developing a wide range of certified skills in visual design, web coding, interaction design, and general technical know-how. I’m a motivated and resourceful learner, and I love finding elegant solutions to complex objectives."
